                <h2>General Instructions</h2>
                <p><strong>Section references</strong> are to the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                
                <h2>Future Developments</h2>
                <p>For the latest information about developments related to Form W-4, such as legislation enacted after it was published, go to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/FormW4">www.irs.gov/FormW4</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>Purpose of Form</h2>
                <p>Complete Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your pay. If too little is withheld, you will generally owe tax when you file your tax return and may owe a penalty. If too much is withheld, you will generally be due a refund. Complete a new Form W-4 when changes to your personal or financial situation would change the entries on the form. For more information on withholding and when you must furnish a new Form W-4, see Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.</p>
                
                <h2>Exemption from Withholding</h2>
                <p>You may claim exemption from withholding for 2024 if you meet both of the following conditions: you had no federal income tax liability in 2023 and you expect to have no federal income tax liability in 2024. You had no federal income tax liability in 2023 if (1) your total tax on line 24 on your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR is zero or less than the sum of lines 27, 28, and 29, or (2) you were not required to file a return because your income was below the filing threshold for your correct filing status. If you claim exemption, you will have no income tax withheld from your paycheck and may owe taxes and penalties when you file your 2024 tax return. To claim exemption from withholding, certify that you meet both of the conditions above by writing “Exempt” on Form W-4 in the space below Step 4(c). Then, complete Steps 1(a), 1(b), and 5. Do not complete any other steps. You will need to submit a new Form W-4 by February 15, 2025.</p>
                
                <h2>Privacy</h2>
                <p>If you do not want your employer to know about your nonwage income (interest, dividends, etc.), you may choose step 4(a) instead. This option is available if you complete Step 4(a) and provide additional withholding on Form W-4.</p>
                
                <h2>Nonresident Aliens</h2>
                <p>If you are a nonresident alien, see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens, before completing this form.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="right-column">
                <h2>Specific Instructions</h2>
                
                <h3>Step 1(c)</h3>
                <p>Check your anticipated filing status. This will determine the standard deduction and tax rates used to compute your withholding.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Use this step if you (1) have more than one job at the same time, or (2) are married filing jointly and you and your spouse both work.</p>
                <p>Option (a) most accurately calculates the additional tax you need to have withheld, while option (b) does so with a little less accuracy.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>This step provides instructions for determining the amount of the child tax credit and the credit for other dependents that you may be able to claim when you file your tax return. To qualify for the child tax credit, the child must be under age 17 as of the end of the year, a U.S. citizen, national, or resident alien, and have a valid Social Security number. You may be able to claim a credit for other dependents for whom a child tax credit can't be claimed, such as an older child or a child without a Social Security number, or other qualifying relative.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 4 (optional)</h3>
                <p>Enter in this step the total of your other estimated income for the year. You shouldn't include income from any jobs or self-employment. If you complete Step 4(a), you likely won't have to pay estimated tax and can avoid tax penalties. Complete Step 4(b) if you expect to claim deductions other than the standard deduction and want to reduce your withholding to account for these deductions. This includes both itemized deductions and other deductions such as for student loan interest and IRAs.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 4(c)</h3>
                <p>Enter in this step any additional tax you want withheld from your pay each pay period, including any amounts from the Multiple Jobs Worksheet, line 4. Entering a number will reduce your paycheck and will either increase your refund or reduce any amount of tax that you owe.</p>

    <div class="page-container-1">
        <h2>Step 2(b)—Multiple Jobs Worksheet <span class="note">(Keep for your records.)</span></h2>
        <p>If you choose the option in Step 2(b) on Form W-4, complete this worksheet which calculates the total extra tax for all jobs on only ONE Form W-4. Withholding will be most accurate if you complete the worksheet and enter the result on Form W-4 for the highest paying job. To be accurate, submit a new Form W-4 for all other jobs if you have not updated your withholding since 2019.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If more than one job has annual wages of more than $120,000 or there are more than three jobs, see Pub. 505 for additional tables, or you can use the withholding estimator at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/W4App">www.irs.gov/W4App</a>.</p>
